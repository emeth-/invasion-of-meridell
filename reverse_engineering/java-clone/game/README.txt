Readme for Defense of Meridor Beta (Dec 3 build)

Warning: This is a beta build
The game's interface and mechanics are still in development and subject to change.
There may be bugs in the current version. It is advised that you save after each battle.
Please report any issues or suggestions to /u/darkflagrance

Start the game by running "DefenseOfMeridorBeta120315.jar".

To start the campaign, simply click the opening screen. The menu offers new campaign, save, and load options.
NOTE: You cannot save in-battle progress
-Saving during a battle will still preserve your campaign progress up to the current battle.

The campaign consists of 10 missions, of 3 battles each.

The goal of each battle is to turn each of the enemy units to your side, or else destroy them.
You must ensure at least 3 out of the 6 villages survive the battle.
After each battle, you may select up to 5 soldiers to continue to the next battle.
-It is recommended that you maintain the same team of 5 to take advantage of their unique strengths and experience.
-That said, there may be times when you wish to replace your veterans with new recruits.

Pick up equipment on the field to increase your pets' power! Each pet can use one weapon and one armor.
-Pay attention to item descriptions! Some items have special abilities that are crucial to victory!
-Some items give additional stats to certain pets.

Collect the treasure at the top of the map to increase your pets' attack and defense!
Each mission has a unique available treasure that can be collected in any of its battles.
If you collect the treasure, it will not appear later (because you already saved it).
If you complete the mission without collecting the treasure, it is lost forever.

Potions heal your pets for most of their hp, before vanishing.

Your rank will periodically increase as you complete battles and missions.
-Your current rank will be shown on the army select screen.

Your pets also rank up based on saves. The saves required to rank up in this version are as follows:

			"Villager"  --0 total saves
			"Defender"  --3
			"Warrior"   --9
			"Lieutenant"--32
			"Captain"   --64
			"Guardian"  --96

Good luck!

============================================================================

To veterans of the original game:

The mechanics have been reverse-engineered and implemented from scratch.
Consequently, they may differ from the mechanics as remembered or as recorded in old guides.
Notable differences:
Enemy numbers and stats
Heals and potions
Enemy pathfinding
Enemy tile-selection priority searches different squares first!!!
Buzzes cannot teleport from one edge to another
Enemy pets sealing healing/teleporting
There are more items implemented, and some items have been tweaked slightly


Fight cautiously, but be of good cheer!
